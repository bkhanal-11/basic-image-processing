# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for Image Compression

The basic concept is to represent an image with size $m \times n$ as a two-dimensional $m \times n$ matrix. SVD is then applied to this matrix to obtain $U$, $\sum$ and $V$ martices. $\sum$ is a diagonal $m \times n$ matrix whose number of non-zero elements on the diagona; determine the rank of the original matrix, $U$ is $m \times n$ unitary matrix which consists of left-singular vectors of original matrix, and $V$ is $n \times n$ unitary matrix which consists of right-singular vectors. $U$ and $V = V^{T}$ are orthogonal matrix.

For original image, $A = U \sum V^{T}$, where $\sum = diag(\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, ..., \sigma_{k}, 0,0,0,0)$. Here, the zero element in the diagonal do not really contribute to the image, hence we can exclude these zero to gain a loss-less compression of image. That is, new image becomes, $A' = U' {\sum}' V'^{T}$, where ${\sum}'$ is $k \times k$ matrix which consists only of only $k$ non-zero element (can also exclude these non-zero element for even lower compression) for original diagonal matrix. For this we change $U$ and $V$ as well so that the become $m \times k$ and $k \times n$. matrices.
